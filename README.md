- Drivers in Rural & Suburban make significantly more money / ride than drivers in urban segment. 
    - Rural : \$55.5 per ride per driver
    - Suburban : \$ 39.5 per ride per driver
    - Urban : \$16.6 per ride per driver
- There may be scope optimization in Driver Utilization rate esp. in Urban. However more analysis should be conducted around ride Dates/times, Driver availability(Part-time , Full time etc) to understand the rate of utlization

### Further Analysis areas
- Peak & non-Peak times/ Dates 
- Demands for Pyber services across cities vs. Availability
